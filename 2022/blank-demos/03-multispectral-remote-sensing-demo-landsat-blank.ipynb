    "> At over 40 years, the Landsat series of satellites provides the longest temporal record of moderate resolution multispectral data of the Earth’s surface on a global basis. The Landsat record has remained remarkably unbroken, proving a unique resource to assist a broad range of specialists in managing the world’s food, water, forests, and other natural resources for a growing world population.  It is a record unmatched in quality, detail, coverage, and value. Source: <a href=\"https://landsat.usgs.gov/about-landsat\" target=\"_blank\">USGS</a>\n",

    "the file naming convention. The metadata tell you how the data were processed,\n",
    "where the data are from and how they are structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file names, tell you what sensor collected the data, the date the data were collected, and more.\n",

    "### Landsat File Naming Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Landsat and many other satellite remote sensing data is named in a way that tells you a about:\n",

    "* When the data were collected and processed\n",
    "* What sensor was used to collect the data\n",
    "* What satellite was used to collect the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will learn a few key components of the landsat 8 collection file name. The first scene that you work with below is named:\n",
    "\n",
    "`LC080340322016072301T1-SC20180214145802`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have LC08\n",
    "\n",
    "* **L:** Landsat Sensor\n",
    "* **C:** OLI / TIRS combined platform\n",
    "* **08:** Landsat 8 (not 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **034032:** The next 6 digits represent the path and row of the scene. This identifies the spatial coverage of the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you have a date. In your case as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **20160723:** representing the year, month and day that the data were collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the file name above tells you more about when the data were last processed. You can read more about this naming convention using the link below.\n",

    "As you work wtih these data, it is good to double check that you are working with the sensor (Landsat 8) and the time period that you intend. Having this information in the file name makes it easier to keep track of this as you process your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Landsat .tif Files in Python\n",
