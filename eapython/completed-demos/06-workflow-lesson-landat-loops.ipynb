    "# Start Your Workflow  With Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding can seem daunting when you are starting from scratch. Start with what \n",
    "you know - English or whatever your native language is! Write out the steps \n",
    "as comments FIRST. Then go back and fill out the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is similar to starting a paper with an outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you know that you have two directories of landsat scenes to \n",
    "process. You could process each directory individually, howerever the code\n",
    "to do this will get complex and difficult to manage quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using loops and well-named functions you can simplify your workflow. But, \n",
    "to create useful workflows you need to first create a workflow design using \n",
    "pseudo code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note some people will even diagram out their workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Save Intermediate Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach in this course so far to save objects has been to name objects\n",
    "individually and use them as needed. However, **Python** has the `dictionary` \n",
    "structure that allows you to create unique keys that can be used to \n",
    "access stored objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`modis[\"date-here\"][\"ndvi\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "could be used to store the NDVI output layer for modis data at a particular date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will build out a workflow from scratch. You will start with \n",
    "the core loop as an individual item that loops through directories and \n",
    "parses important metadata (such as the date associated with a remote sensing\n",
    "file).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To begin you have two scenes to process. This could warrant a LOOP to process both scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# 1. Loop through both landsat scenes\n",
    "    * create a list with paths for both scenes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you know from your previous assignment that the DATE for which the Landsat\n",
    "scene  was  captured  and processed is stored in the filename itself.\n",
    "Expand this pseudocode to add grabbing the scene date.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# 1. Loop through both landsat scenes\n",
    "    * create a list with paths to both scenes\n",
    "    * in each iteraction, grab the date from the directory name\n",
    "    * create an empty dictionary with a key for that date\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below this pseudocode is implemented in a cell using comments. Add the code \n",
    "required to build out the pseudo-code into functioning code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build your loop iteratively and run it as you add a line or two of code to \n",
    "ensure things work as you expect them to. Notice below there are print \n",
    "statements added to ensure the output is as expected! \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great way to ensure that your paths are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build out the Full Workflow in Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "**fill in steps as you go**\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue with this pseudocode approach and build out the entire workflow. \n",
    "In your first pass you won't get all of the individual steps down. This is ok\n",
    "just get things started and build it out as you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: this notebook as a demo has many cells, you'd most likely build out your \n",
    "workflow in a single cell or two. i generally like to add a loop AFTER the cell\n",
    "that contains the functions that the loop calls.\n",
